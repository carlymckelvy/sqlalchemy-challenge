# sqlalchemy-challenge

In anticiapation of an upcoming trip to Hawaii, I was asked to analalyze weather data for the previous year.  I utilized Python and SQLAlchemy to look at precipitation and temperature readings at various weather stations in order to suggest the most opportune time of year and area of the state to visit.  

Once the analysis was complete, I designed a Flask API to show the precipitation, weather station, and temperature data, as well as tool to search for weather within a specific date range.
